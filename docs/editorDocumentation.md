# Cicero Writer - Editor Documentation
Here you will find information on the specifics and general overview of each type of feature in the writer portion of Cicero AKA the 'editor'.

## Text-Based Editor
The editor allows for all of the standard text editor features, including:
- Bold and italics
- Header Styles (1-6)
- Bulleted and Numbered Lists
- Tabbing, copying, deleting, and creating new lines.

All of the primary text-based features can be toggled and applied using various shortcuts which you can find in the menu: help > shortcuts.

Keep in mind there are some limits to how you can use these features. Some of them are:
- Headings can not be list items but list items can be styled freely.
